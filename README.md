# Bio-Track
I have created a project with the help of Java and SQL on Smart Health Monitoring name Bio Track. It is a multilanguage program with 5 different languages: English, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil and Telgu, which stores your health records like heart rate, blood pressure, sugar level and many more. Not only this it also analysis the inserted health record.Even you can access the records with the help of given user id.
